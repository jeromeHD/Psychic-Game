# Psychic-Game

Start by guessing any letter.  

If you match the computer guess you will win and not lose a turn; recording a win

If you do not match the computer you will lose one guess per letter.  After 9 guesses you will record
a loss.

After every correct guess your guess counter will reset to 9.

Enjoy!!
